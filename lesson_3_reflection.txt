When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    When multiple people working on project or one person working from multiple
    computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Changes on GitHub may have been made by others, that you may not want to include yet. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - makes a GitHub copy of anothers GitHub repo - to work on someone elses 			
           code without altering their copy
    Clone - makes a local copy of a GitHub repo - makes a copy on local machine 		  
            to work with
    Branch - makes an alternate 'thread' within a repo - create an 'alt' version 
    	     to work/play with that may or maynot be merged into main line
